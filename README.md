# AppSleuth

A minimal utility for listing macOS application bundles, classifying them as
*essential* or *candidates* and optionally exporting reports.

```
python3 app_sleuth.py --export-csv apps.csv --export-json apps.json
```

This repository contains a simplified implementation focusing on inventory and
classification logic.
